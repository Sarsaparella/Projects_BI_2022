# Bioinformatics Institute educational projects

This repository contains all projects that I made over the course of my one-year training program at Bioinformatics Institute.

Each project folder contains lab notebook and small paper that I wrote based on the results.

Here are the list of the projects:

- What causes antibiotic resistance? Alignment to reference, variant calling.
    
    Tools: FastQC, Trimmomatic, BWA-MEM, samtools, VarScan, snpEff
    
- “Why did I get the flu?”. Deep sequencing, error control, p-value, viral evolution.
    
    Tools: Snakemake, BWA-MEM, samtools, VarScan, awk
    
- *E.coli* 2011 outbreak investigation.
    
    Tools: SPAdes, jellyfish, QUAST, prokka, ResFinder, Mauve
    

Be ware, all projects were made in tight deadlines and meant to be purely educational, so some mistakes are very much possible.
