# Bioinformatics Institute educational projects

This repository contains all projects that I made throught my one-year training program at Bioinformatics Institute (Sept 2022 - June 2023).

Each project folder contains a lab notebook and a small paper that I wrote based on the results.

Here is the list of all projects:

- What causes antibiotic resistance? Alignment to reference, variant calling.
    
    Tools: FastQC, Trimmomatic, BWA-MEM, samtools, VarScan, snpEff
    
- “Why did I get the flu?”. Deep sequencing, error control, p-value, viral evolution.
    
    Tools: Snakemake, BWA-MEM, samtools, VarScan, awk
    
- *E.coli* 2011 outbreak investigation.
    
    Tools: SPAdes, jellyfish, QUAST, prokka, ResFinder, Mauve
    
- Tardigrades: from genestealers to space marines (my fav ^^)

    New bioinformatics skills covered: gene prediction, functional annotation, protein localization
    
    Tools: AUGUSTUS, Diamond, WoLF PSORT, TargetP 1.1 Server, HMMER
    
- H+, or how to build a perfect human.

    Tools and databases: plink, MtDNA_tools, Y-DNA_tools, VEP (Variant Effect Predictor), dbSNP, SNPedia, OMIM
    
- Baking Bad: Differential RNA expression analysis

    New bioinformatics skills covered: splice-junction aware alignment, guided transcript assembly, differential expression analysis
    
    Tools: HISAT2, Deseq2, gffread,     
    
- Dead Man’s Teeth. Introduction to metagenomics analysis.

    New bioinformatics skills covered: 16S vs whole metagenome, alignment, ASV clustering.
    
    Tools: QIIME2, samtools, BWA-MEM, BEDtools


Be ware, all projects were made in tight deadlines and meant to be purely educational, so some mistakes are very much possible	(っ˘̩╭╮˘̩)っ
