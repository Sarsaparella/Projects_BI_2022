# Bioinformatics Institute educational projects

This repository contains all projects that I made throught my one-year training program at Bioinformatics Institute (Sept 2022 - June 2023).

Each project folder contains a lab notebook and a small paper that I wrote based on the results.

Here is the list of all projects:

- What causes antibiotic resistance? Alignment to reference, variant calling.
    
    Tools: FastQC, Trimmomatic, BWA-MEM, samtools, VarScan, snpEff
    
- “Why did I get the flu?”. Deep sequencing, error control, p-value, viral evolution.
    
    Tools: Snakemake, BWA-MEM, samtools, VarScan, awk
    
- *E.coli* 2011 outbreak investigation.
    
    Tools: SPAdes, jellyfish, QUAST, prokka, ResFinder, Mauve
    

Be ware, all projects were made in tight deadlines and meant to be purely educational, so some mistakes are very much possible.
